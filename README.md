# TwoColumns
Sublime Text plugin to ensure two columns layout on every window.

## Background: Why not Origami?
- difficult to use, so many commands ...
- if hitting the wrong key combination you end up with a very different layout like three panes if you just wanted to move a file
- no automatic layout setting
- cloning a view requires to specify the pane to clone to, in a two column layout this makes no sense

## Usage
- Just install via PackageControl
- Every window will automatically possess a two column window from now on (there is no way to set a different one for specific windows)
- use ctrl+alt+d to clone a view to the other pane
- use inbuilt key binding for move_to_neighboring_group to move view to other pane
